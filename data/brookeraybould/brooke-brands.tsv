 É. For any product links you see in the video - including my outfit, glasses, butterfly laptop case, and more! And, save this post for your next hair appointment - for all the blondes out there!
 

 Here is the color formula that David uses to get my blonde color É
 

 Lightener with 25 Volume
 K 18 Treatment 
 Root Smudge REDKEN shade EQ: Formula is 9N and 9GI
 All Over Gloss
 Crystal Clear and 10VG
 

 É hopefully I understood him correctly, if any hair stylists want to correct me - go for it!
 

 The appointment was 10:30 AM to 3:30 PM! Definitely long, but certainly worth it - when you find someone who creates the perfect color and look É and he is right down the street from us!
 

 Usually, I go on my own and Ryan is able to help with the boys. I will never pay for a sitter to get my hair done because it feels like youÕre double paying. So, I always try to find a way to do it when Ryan can help or I can bring my boys with me.
 

 I did film this during the school year - so it helped that I had the littles in preschool - and since the big boys homeschool, I brought them along (field trip!). I was worried my big boys might get bored, but the opposite happened - they LOVED it. After the appointment, they kept asking and begging to go back with me.
 

 During the appointment, they stayed busy with school on the iPad, reading, and walking to boba / grabbing treats. They took DavidÕs dog for a walk. It was really sweet. Sure, there were times when they were messing around - and I still enjoy the times when I get to go on my own - but, if youÕre in a pinch - this totally worked. 
 

 Sometimes, as moms, we get nervous about bringing kids along, but IÕve realized that in order for me to live my life, my kids are going to have to join me - even on some of the more adult activities. So long as they respect other people there, IÕm totally good with it!"	brookeraybould	Brooke Raybould	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/347818603_571591758186661_1293263663191613457_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=KZlq1MVzWn4Q7kNvgHSvm26&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDCp0-4VyK0lKY2nMOOpQtXaZ9MKWcZmAC-VCmUaz8dJQ&oe=66B1007F&_nc_sid=0b30b7	2024-07-09 18:42:03	video	https://www.instagram.com/p/C9NX_Z7vr4B	https://instagram.fgrq1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/450254460_1939498913192682_4368535171765659181_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi4xMTY3eDIwNzkuc2RyLmYyOTM1MCJ9&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=GaFjrN1Pk8oQ7kNvgF53Fp3&gid=4f6da2531a2449328f614e8c6dac23e2&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzQwODQ4NjAwNTIzMjAyNTA4OQ%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYAiMK73JCBa5Juw2EwQ8Xd30hSsFOfHjS3Vgu4atOke2w&oe=66B1020D&_nc_sid=0b30b7	https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/o1/v/t16/f2/m69/An_jj_D4qR8b8Un0f5I8dxAe_Xc_DZTmohpMpVb5aqrWp-JrePgC6yqr8ruK_XEeNKWr7_Jlz5BbLby6TAaGbOHN.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6Inhwdl9wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS5JTlNUQUdSQU0uQ0xJUFMuQzMuMTA4MC5kYXNoX2Jhc2VsaW5lXzEwODBwX3YxIn0&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&strext=1&vs=3be7c9aa0c05e088&_nc_vs=HBksFQIYOnBhc3N0aHJvdWdoX2V2ZXJzdG9yZS9HUDRBekFMU3V1OXVoYzRGQU9zaGZMRjRPVlJtYnBSMUFBQUYVAALIAQAVAhg6cGFzc3Rocm91Z2hfZXZlcnN0b3JlL0dPUEx2QnBDTnNZQy1NWWRBQnJSZEF0bTBsRXdicV9FQUFBRhUCAsgBACgAGAAbAogHdXNlX29pbAExEnByb2dyZXNzaXZlX3JlY2lwZQExFQAAJsbemMvh4vgCFQIoAkMzLBdAU5dsi0OVgRgWZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xMDgwcF92MREAdf4HAA%3D%3D&ccb=9-4&oh=00_AYCBsGyA_L8jS2tjrJ86cyHr91fVNWtjg6rmPx7NOlR8yw&oe=66AD1882&_nc_sid=1d576d		4079	203	1				1720543323	450254460_1939498913192682_4368535171765659181_n.jpg	Redken	@redken	Haircare products	Cosmetics

 É and I will randomly select three families to send movie tickets to see Despicable Me 4 in theaters July 3rd! #ad @kinderus @minions
 

 The Minions are near and dear to our hearts! Quade doesnÕt love watching television, but fell in love with the Minions awhile back. ItÕs the only movie he watches over and over again. When I saw that Despicable Me 4 was coming out AND Kinder Joy Despicable Me 4 Eggs were available, I knew I needed to do something special for the boys.
 

 Kinder Joy Despicable Me 4 Eggs feature a treat and toy all-in-one. The treat includes two soft cream layers with two wafer bits on top. And the toy side features 8 varieties of toys (at random) that include a suction feature to keep your kids entertained for hours!
 

 This surprise was a hit, and so was Despicable Me 4! Highly recommend it. In fact, my boys said it was their favorite yet. #DM4 #DespicableMe4 #KinderJoy"	brookeraybould	Brooke Raybould	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/347818603_571591758186661_1293263663191613457_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=KZlq1MVzWn4Q7kNvgHSvm26&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDCp0-4VyK0lKY2nMOOpQtXaZ9MKWcZmAC-VCmUaz8dJQ&oe=66B1007F&_nc_sid=0b30b7	2024-07-08 19:04:12	video	https://www.instagram.com/p/C9K1ThEgXae	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/450596756_501872348966590_8032841489183135511_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi43MjB4MTI4MC5zZHIuZjI5MzUwIn0&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=9UOjH72JHi0Q7kNvgFmzre5&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzQwNzc3MDUwNTcwMzQyMTU5OA%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYARafCzULD-kPGyeQwRp5QHEmtDoXRFd5oIxIjpFFWiYA&oe=66B13031&_nc_sid=0b30b7	https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/o1/v/t16/f2/m69/An_Af4r73NgRRO_exROQmG6rl7x-d0TEmyaNJPTsvyyb6cWc8OQstuvx9-ZZnHaLzVAWSeZ4jKxjn_jdBOPJbG9v.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6Inhwdl9wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS5JTlNUQUdSQU0uQ0xJUFMuQzMuMTA4MC5kYXNoX2Jhc2VsaW5lXzEwODBwX3YxIn0&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&strext=1&vs=dd208052665ca95f&_nc_vs=HBksFQIYOnBhc3N0aHJvdWdoX2V2ZXJzdG9yZS9HQlluQ2hNX3VSbHVoNUFCQUExZHljeXJHOEVwYnBSMUFBQUYVAALIAQAVAhg6cGFzc3Rocm91Z2hfZXZlcnN0b3JlL0dFSWgyaHF3MWxaN05Wa0RBT1VlUTFHcHkyTVlicV9FQUFBRhUCAsgBACgAGAAbAogHdXNlX29pbAExEnByb2dyZXNzaXZlX3JlY2lwZQExFQAAJq6fkMH6v5kEFQIoAkMzLBdARq7ZFocrAhgWZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xMDgwcF92MREAdf4HAA%3D%3D&ccb=9-4&oh=00_AYDOtiUT4O4IdjXoXzDFxq9wJGZQ7qDVBZYJMzilzlQeZw&oe=66AD0A8B&_nc_sid=1d576d	ad,DM4,DespicableMe4,KinderJoy	2555	690	1				1720458252	450596756_501872348966590_8032841489183135511_n.jpg	Kinder U.S.	@kinderus	Chocolate snack	Food

 É. To get the links to my travel favorites - including my favorite Beis Backpack, Beis Toiletry Bag, travel outfits - and anything else you saw in this video!
 

 Travel tips for big families:
 Try to be a minimalist packer and pack in one suitcase. And, always use packing cubes! There is a device on Amazon that allows you to weigh your suitcase before you leave (I included it in the links!).
 

 For the plane with kids:
 Snackle boxes and tablets with shows and games. __
 

 Bring a stroller and gate check it.
 With these tips, youÕll travel like a pro!
 

 NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, we love you! If you didnÕt know, we lived in Nashville from 2016 to 2018 in an area called 12 South. I LOVED living there. Our second born son, Vance, was born there - so we just had our oldest two in that area.
 

 Share any of your favorite spots in Nashville. Some of ours are:
 Our favorite spots in 12 South are: Frothy Monkey, Burger Up, WhiteÕs Mercantile.
 Our favorite spot in the Gulch: Saint Anejo for Mexican!
 Our favorite bars on Broadway: This Bar - Morgan Wallen and AldeanÕs.
 

 Nashville is booming right now - any time we get the chance to go back, I absolutely love it. If I could convince Ryan, IÕd move back!!
 

 Thankfully, we have family in the area, which gives us an excuse to go back. ________"	brookeraybould	Brooke Raybould	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/347818603_571591758186661_1293263663191613457_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=KZlq1MVzWn4Q7kNvgHSvm26&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDCp0-4VyK0lKY2nMOOpQtXaZ9MKWcZmAC-VCmUaz8dJQ&oe=66B1007F&_nc_sid=0b30b7	2024-07-06 20:14:26	video	https://www.instagram.com/p/C9F0O2-Pqbx	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/450136064_1406545153343967_2904861434389911461_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi43MjB4MTI4MC5zZHIuZjI5MzUwIn0&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=3LswHbvNYRcQ7kNvgEjKqYJ&gid=4f6da2531a2449328f614e8c6dac23e2&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzQwNjM1ODQxMjY5MzI1MTgyNQ%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYCahJjvpAjwPpyiuTZb-k8z6tUBgp-dk9ic5OAsZCJ9HA&oe=66B0FEE7&_nc_sid=0b30b7	https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/o1/v/t16/f2/m69/An_I78W7fueTffaT6zDsSFAovS1O3zAIkeyoNiFa6zQJG_MOJ9UdmxCUp2PZuPBm6RyXM53givqblXWEuXY7sFg.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6Inhwdl9wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS5JTlNUQUdSQU0uQ0xJUFMuQzMuMTA4MC5kYXNoX2Jhc2VsaW5lXzEwODBwX3YxIn0&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&strext=1&vs=2c46e9dcb6f568c9&_nc_vs=HBksFQIYOnBhc3N0aHJvdWdoX2V2ZXJzdG9yZS9HR2YyTEJQbFd1bmtpaFlEQUdsdDNURUw5Y3dTYnBSMUFBQUYVAALIAQAVAhg6cGFzc3Rocm91Z2hfZXZlcnN0b3JlL0dLUVZ3eHJFdlF6eDBaVUJBRGkxWnJ1V0FOQVNicV9FQUFBRhUCAsgBACgAGAAbAogHdXNlX29pbAExEnByb2dyZXNzaXZlX3JlY2lwZQExFQAAJozTj7%2FOyKYBFQIoAkMzLBdAVnMzMzMzMxgWZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xMDgwcF92MREAdf4HAA%3D%3D&ccb=9-4&oh=00_AYAoOeL5Kl87fipXJbm05U8D_WJNCNwMjFXaONMupIhohA&oe=66AD26B8&_nc_sid=1d576d		5014	637	1				1720289666	450136064_1406545153343967_2904861434389911461_n.jpg	BE_IS	@beis	Travel bags, backpack	Accessories

 When I first became a mom, I used to think that drinking wine, Netflix, and scrolling social media in bed was Òself-care.Ó Then, I realized that my body doesnÕt process alcohol that well. Netflix doesnÕt have many redeeming shows (to my knowledge). And social media scrolling for too long makes my brain feel like mush. I had to take a hard look at my habits to re-consider what was truly positive, and what was holding me back. 
 

 The @alomoves platform is a GREAT platform itÕs one of my favorites because it focuses on POSITIVE habits. Whether itÕs affirmations, breath work, meditations, fitness, high intensity, or nutrition, Alo Moves has SOMETHING that I can dive into that will give BACK to me rather than take away from me. 
 

 There is a quote I love by Lala Delia that goes, ÒSelf-care is how you take your power back.Ó My morning routine is a way to really give back power to myself. 
 

 While these habits may seem difficult at first, what I realized is that itÕs even more difficult to live without them - it takes my power away. Instead, waking up early makes me feel like I am ahead of my day. Making the bed gives me confidence. Writing out my day makes me feel organized. Running and weight lifting boost my mental game and make me feel strong. Cold plunging spikes my dopamine and my brain feels so clear. Getting myself ready for the day helps me feel successful. I am a woman who loves formulas. So, when you find one that helps you feel like youÕre ahead of the day and in control of your life, you keep on doing it. @alomoves is a great place to start! ____ AloMovesPartner"	brookeraybould	Brooke Raybould	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/347818603_571591758186661_1293263663191613457_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=KZlq1MVzWn4Q7kNvgHSvm26&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDCp0-4VyK0lKY2nMOOpQtXaZ9MKWcZmAC-VCmUaz8dJQ&oe=66B1007F&_nc_sid=0b30b7	2024-06-28 16:31:25	video	https://www.instagram.com/p/C8w0FVvAQsy	https://instagram.fgrq1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/449428552_3935798933367652_1317944193159131843_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi43MjB4MTI4MC5zZHIuZjI5MzUwIn0&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=OKZntFezNXoQ7kNvgFupt49&gid=4f6da2531a2449328f614e8c6dac23e2&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzQwMDQ0Njc4NDAxNzg2MTQyNg%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYDpcQhiszidn3JWYcZBZwSHdL_PlyuVl-X3KfaD7RrL4A&oe=66B10366&_nc_sid=0b30b7	https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/o1/v/t16/f2/m69/An_suqO5xeyLGgcv1LAM4virIQARgSFzE8GrD8XxWxOEcoqwSN7hXuoe-bWALn2IoYhyn88PbCZjZBuHIObhMF2F.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6Inhwdl9wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS5JTlNUQUdSQU0uQ0xJUFMuQzMuMTA4MC5kYXNoX2Jhc2VsaW5lXzEwODBwX3YxIn0&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&strext=1&vs=bae10ad208190df6&_nc_vs=HBksFQIYOnBhc3N0aHJvdWdoX2V2ZXJzdG9yZS9HQ2VHdXdKWkZlX1VwcEFEQUdoU2ZhRkZqdGdWYnBSMUFBQUYVAALIAQAVAhg6cGFzc3Rocm91Z2hfZXZlcnN0b3JlL0dDaW90aHFBM2lwaU16NEJBSWtGSXFKYzVod01icV9FQUFBRhUCAsgBACgAGAAbAogHdXNlX29pbAExEnByb2dyZXNzaXZlX3JlY2lwZQExFQAAJsr34O2GhrwBFQIoAkMzLBdATwzMzMzMzRgWZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xMDgwcF92MREAdf4HAA%3D%3D&ccb=9-4&oh=00_AYBu6WnfYl5q5MjAVaFpJ-y6zHadoi1KeMJd81vOAjQMeA&oe=66AD3D69&_nc_sid=1d576d		6862	1389	1				1719585085	449428552_3935798933367652_1317944193159131843_n.jpg	Alo Moves	@alomoves	Fitness and meditation classes on a digital platform	Health & Wellness

 Not only do we love our @getlomi, but I think itÕs the most popular product amongst you all. But, seriously, how COOL is Lomi? Apparently, itÕs REALLY cool because it sold out in TWO hours during its initial launch. But, we have access to the available supply - and $100 off! #LomiPartner
 

 Lomi will become your kitchen companion (like it has for us!). It is the worldÕs first Smart Waste appliance that transforms almost anything we eat into nutrient-rich plant food in 3 hours! 
 

 We keep our little bucket in a kitchen drawer for food scraps. With the tap of a button, youÕll have yourself plant food that is as organic as itÕs going to get. Add to your outdoor lawn or garden and watch things grow like youÕve never seen before!
 

 Some FAQÕs answered:
 -No, the Lomi does not smell.
 -The bucket is dishwasher safe.
 -There is a Òself-cleaning modeÓ you can select on your Lomi, too!
 

 You will not only reduce your carbon footprint and see your garden grow, but you can also turn your trash into cash with the Lomi Rewards program (using the Lomi app). 
 

 This appliance is one of a kind, and itÕs been rewarding to see the boys understand the impact we can make, especially going into the summer!

 ... and IÕll send you the link to the @funablessnacks! Funables is the perfect (and fun!) family summer snack - made with real fruit puree (**7.1% real fruit puree. Not intended to replace fruits and vegetables) and vitamins A, C, and E. Plus, fun word searches, mazes, tic-tac-toe and more!
 

 Everything else I got online! Whether youÕre roadtripping or driving around town, this is a GREAT car setup for kids. As I was setting this up, Rhett told me we need to keep it Òjust becauseÓ rather than exclusively for a road trip occasion. I couldnÕt agree more!
 

 Generally, when it comes to travel we fall into the Òjungle rulesÓ category, meaning screen time and fun snacks are allowed, but itÕs nice to have options to break up the trip, focusing less on screen time and more on fun, family-based activities.
 

 Who else was part of the era that had to road trip and fly without screens? I love giving my kids a taste of the good olÕ days.
 

 Happy road tripping and cheers to a fun summer of 2024! @funablessnacks #FunablesFruitySnacks"	brookeraybould	Brooke Raybould	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/347818603_571591758186661_1293263663191613457_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=KZlq1MVzWn4Q7kNvgHSvm26&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDCp0-4VyK0lKY2nMOOpQtXaZ9MKWcZmAC-VCmUaz8dJQ&oe=66B1007F&_nc_sid=0b30b7	2024-06-19 20:10:43	video	https://www.instagram.com/p/C8aCRm3PSnv	https://instagram.fgrq1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/448579331_1225566801940984_1754742842379496929_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi43MjB4MTI4MC5zZHIuZjI5MzUwIn0&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=vpd87TrqoO0Q7kNvgHAPB0G&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzM5NDAzNTI3NTIzMDE2MTM5MQ%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYBiU6vB8hRPrVeCTfK9N434jwwut8GqIn9I_BpqEWZ_YA&oe=66B12D88&_nc_sid=0b30b7	https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/o1/v/t16/f2/m69/An_FFv4gdTwNy3Fvah-bQgTPPLwD07Cddv-3kN5abGdvqOnROFzUgKKrDQMMNvx-wWi_3ryPGPntSjAj2MMfjUcN.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6Inhwdl9wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS5JTlNUQUdSQU0uQ0xJUFMuQzMuMTA4MC5kYXNoX2Jhc2VsaW5lXzEwODBwX3YxIn0&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&strext=1&vs=40578d08cbbf4f12&_nc_vs=HBksFQIYOnBhc3N0aHJvdWdoX2V2ZXJzdG9yZS9HRnNDTndjbVRfUlpkYWtIQURZakFGcHR3TEpkYnBSMUFBQUYVAALIAQAVAhg6cGFzc3Rocm91Z2hfZXZlcnN0b3JlL0dLcDdKUnBzNjNNa2ZtNE1BQ3JSR1BUbGhrY3hicV9FQUFBRhUCAsgBACgAGAAbAogHdXNlX29pbAExEnByb2dyZXNzaXZlX3JlY2lwZQExFQAAJrbX%2Fbjvl6gDFQIoAkMzLBdAQi7ZFocrAhgWZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xMDgwcF92MREAdf4HAA%3D%3D&ccb=9-4&oh=00_AYD2sYEwv-XUbSfpbdWMRQfNbOe561ib-3PyLy3HzjqtsA&oe=66AD3CC9&_nc_sid=1d576d	ad,FunablesFruitySnacks	2201	296	1				1718820643	448579331_1225566801940984_1754742842379496929_n.jpg	Funables Snacks	@funablessnacks	Healthy, fruit-based snacks	Food

 É. To get the link to the @resqme.inc on amazon, the 2-1 emergency tool created in the USA for First Responders that breaks car windows and cuts jammed seat belts quickly and easily! Designed specifically for tempered glass car windows, Resqme can be a lifesaver in different scary scenarios, such as a car submersion, fire, rollover or entrapment! This small device can be stored in so many convenient places such as on the rearview mirror, headrest, visor, or keychain. If you purchase the accessory pack, you even get a visor clip!
  
 I remember the day Beauden got locked in the car so vividly. The background of the story - I was visiting my parents in remote Colorado. My mom and I went to the grocery store in her new car with Beauden. He was about a year and half. We got back to the car, I put Beauden in his carseat, placed the groceries into the trunk, then closed the trunk. I went to open the driverÕs side door... locked. #ResqmePartner
  
 I tried the other doors. All locked. We called the police, but they wouldnÕt be there for an hour or so. It was summer and the temperature was high eighties and I was panicking. At this point, a crowd started forming and we discussed breaking the car window. Just in time, a police officer showed up.
  
 Plot twist. The tool he showed up with didnÕt work upon several tries. We were about ready to give up and break the car window when we finally got his wire contraption to press the unlock button to unlock the doors.
  
 SO SCARY.
  
 IÕm not the only one this has happened to. If you Google ÒCarrie Underwood breaking car windowÓ youÕll find that her dogs accidentally locked themselves in her car with her baby. Her brother-in-law had to break the car window to get them out.
  
 DonÕt let this happen to you! The Resqme is an emergency tool that all moms should have on hand to keep their loved ones safe on the road!"	brookeraybould	Brooke Raybould	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/347818603_571591758186661_1293263663191613457_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=KZlq1MVzWn4Q7kNvgHSvm26&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDCp0-4VyK0lKY2nMOOpQtXaZ9MKWcZmAC-VCmUaz8dJQ&oe=66B1007F&_nc_sid=0b30b7	2024-06-06 19:43:44	video	https://www.instagram.com/p/C74gzDwvv6e	https://instagram.fgrq1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/447786757_1173851276952789_4741536590440072389_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi43MjB4MTI4MC5zZHIuZjI5MzUwIn0&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=FQ76mF69jp4Q7kNvgEs8ooz&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzM4NDU5OTM2NjE4OTY0NTQ3MA%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYDQCGq4sOI-hZ-SdBF4qVCO-p4rvPHty93xXK291K8RuA&oe=66B1117F&_nc_sid=0b30b7	https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/o1/v/t16/f2/m69/An-1EW30-BtoXkHPZqQ2L4H-F_I5ZIJUqNUazd6pr6b-T3SF5eEJ-8anrI1lXAVKgTik1MAx5zCkQbbcO-zSSUOb.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6Inhwdl9wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS5JTlNUQUdSQU0uQ0xJUFMuQzMuMTA4MC5kYXNoX2Jhc2VsaW5lXzEwODBwX3YxIn0&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&strext=1&vs=56ee1ff29e71a02e&_nc_vs=HBksFQIYOnBhc3N0aHJvdWdoX2V2ZXJzdG9yZS9HTW1LS1FmaGZvSXpCNVVCQU5PWFUtUTVGRUFHYnBSMUFBQUYVAALIAQAVAhg6cGFzc3Rocm91Z2hfZXZlcnN0b3JlL0dKQldxeHBxMjZRQ2lETUVBR0duOERyWnFvQmNicV9FQUFBRhUCAsgBACgAGAAbAogHdXNlX29pbAExEnByb2dyZXNzaXZlX3JlY2lwZQExFQAAJtiq3smBxMwDFQIoAkMzLBdAO%2FdLxqfvnhgWZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xMDgwcF92MREAdf4HAA%3D%3D&ccb=9-4&oh=00_AYAzlvNsW2fbAfiBZN1E0IE61hIzI_qoLNEw114MrdDA2g&oe=66AD2908&_nc_sid=1d576d	ResqmePartner	3162	1265	1				1717695824	447786757_1173851276952789_4741536590440072389_n.jpg	Resqme	@resqme.inc	Safety car escape tool	Safety, Automotive

 É. And IÕll send you the link to my organic, all-natural pre-workout - Muscles by Nature by @doctormorses! With my code BROOKE, you get 30% off one-time or subscription purchases!! I like this pre-workout over others because itÕs made by a naturopath who has 50+ years of experience using herbal formulas based on traditional Chinese medicinal practices. ItÕs 100% organic and includes ingredients, like ginseng, eleuthero, and he shou wu root for boosted energy, enhanced athletic performance! I first started taking this before my half marathon training runs and itÕs made the world of a difference. #DoctorMorsesPartner 
 

 As for our new gym membership - this has opened up our world for our family, allowing us to do what we do best: be active! While I have loved my home workouts for the past four years, it was time to open up our world and expand our horizons.
 

 Going into summer (after a year of homeschooling), I wanted somewhere to go outside of the house. We know A TON of families that are members here, and this gym seemed to offer the entire package for our family. This includes TONS of workout classes, a huge pool with a slide, 2.5 hours of childcare (that offers classes for them too!), a cafe, showers/locker rooms and so much more.
 

 I will continue to do my home workouts a few days a week and intersperse the gym workouts throughout the week, as well! ItÕs nice to have a combo for this stage of life.
 

 Will I continue to wake up at 5 AM? That is the goal! I get SO much done before my kids are up. Whether itÕs a workout, work, or simply mental time to myself - 5 AM is my golden hour. Now, I will be able to choose what I do during that time and push off some things til the later afternoon - all while being able to spend time with and prioritize my kids!

 ButÉ
 

 I hope you can feel through the screen how much we enjoy this trip. And if I could encourage your family to take a Disney trip *just once*, but to do it in a way that makes it less overwhelming, this is that moment!
 

 The Washington Post, NY Post, BUSINESS INSIDER, and Fox News included my Disney guide in articles titled, ÒDisney trips are so complicated now that you need a class now to plan oneÓ É and CNBC titled their article, ÒFans say trips to Disney World are now Ôincredibly complicatedÕ to pull off.Ó
 

 I completely understand that Disney planning is stressful and my entire goal with this guide was to actually AGREE with them. Disney is complicated and the first time we went as a family, it was É blah. But after you learn some of the secrets, systems, and hacks, I promise it becomes more magical and fun.
 

 Love to you all! Will be sharing strategies throughout our trip here.

 If you saw in the video, the Gx bottles are compatible with the Gx pods, which is a Gatorade concentrate that clicks on top of the bottle providing instant hydration for busy, young athletes! I store pods in their bags for ease of use. Rhett even asked for a ÒcustomÓ design for his birthday! 
 

 But, SERIOUSLY. The Sports Mom life is no joke. If you think that playing the sport is hard, try being the parent behind the sport! (kidding, not kidding) IÕm all for it. 
 

 Ryan came from a big family of five that all played soccer through college, and Ryan even ended up playing professionally in the MLS and abroad. Both my sister and I played sports in college, as well, and we know how much sports can teach about life. 
 

 Our boys do A LOT of sports. Rhett (9) and Vance (7) play travel soccer and hockey. Each has one to two practices a day and multiple games on the weekend. Dare I say, this was actually a ÒlightÓ weekend for us. Beauden just started tee ball and plays beginner hockey. Quade just started gymnastics - and Lord help us all when he starts full-on organized sports. 
 

 When grandparents assure me that IÕll miss this one day, sometimes I look at them bewildered. But, deep down I know theyÕre right. This is what these years are made of. 
 

 Behind every young athlete on the field is a Sports Mom who deserves a gold medal. May your vehicle have trunk space and may your water bottles stay found (and full!). I see you, girl. __"	brookeraybould	Brooke Raybould	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/347818603_571591758186661_1293263663191613457_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=KZlq1MVzWn4Q7kNvgHSvm26&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDCp0-4VyK0lKY2nMOOpQtXaZ9MKWcZmAC-VCmUaz8dJQ&oe=66B1007F&_nc_sid=0b30b7	2024-05-20 18:49:20	video	https://www.instagram.com/p/C7Mo30fgBtJ	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/445152132_2473658212839071_5827408790647723224_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi4xMDgweDE5MjAuc2RyLmYyOTM1MCJ9&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=2_g4IsOF5-QQ7kNvgGc2iC-&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzM3MjI0OTk3ODc4ODM4NzY1Nw%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYALDasR_ytkP_3dZ51dG7qKZfTjUGWfCMnBDUeaD9Fb8w&oe=66B11C1E&_nc_sid=0b30b7	https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/o1/v/t16/f2/m69/An-CTNpwuezhUHoDFnH3zsmyOgr9MDYxFd0ENl2yAqm9CUf1lpzhbNgeTbmJ-iu_xydu9LpGHSbRLZe97VR0vceb.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6Inhwdl9wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS5JTlNUQUdSQU0uQ0xJUFMuQzMuMTA4MC5kYXNoX2Jhc2VsaW5lXzEwODBwX3YxIn0&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&strext=1&vs=e60d70f577999ab2&_nc_vs=HBksFQIYOnBhc3N0aHJvdWdoX2V2ZXJzdG9yZS9HQ3k0NHhKSDdINGR2WW9EQUZKLUFqUHJTT2tjYnBSMUFBQUYVAALIAQAVAhg6cGFzc3Rocm91Z2hfZXZlcnN0b3JlL0dIc3plUm83UGZtcXUtVURBQzVIa0JFTWJQQUVicV9FQUFBRhUCAsgBACgAGAAbAogHdXNlX29pbAExEnByb2dyZXNzaXZlX3JlY2lwZQExFQAAJravxoesufgFFQIoAkMzLBdAVeqfvnbItBgWZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xMDgwcF92MREAdf4HAA%3D%3D&ccb=9-4&oh=00_AYD0XGtY7wSyJD3Ax-8vfig60wz-7NGQWlRGQN3fzMjGCw&oe=66AD0617&_nc_sid=1d576d	Gatorade	8994	333	1				1716223760	445152132_2473658212839071_5827408790647723224_n.jpg	Gatorade	@Gatorade	Sports drinks	Beverage

 When I became pregnant with our fifth son, I knew immediately that something was off. At eleven weeks I miscarried. A very low place and traumatic with hormones that, at times, were agonizingly difficult to manage.
 

 I think any woman who has gone through a miscarriage or multiple miscarriages wants answers. I did too. The first thing I did was book an appointment with a traditional endocrinologist - mostly because something felt very OFF.
 

 I had blood drawn, met with the doctor to discuss my symptoms, and a few days later I received a call that, ÒEverything was within normal range. Goodbye..Ó
 

 A part of me was happy that my levels were normal, but another part of me knew that SOMETHING was wrong. I was angry that they didnÕt offer to go deeper. Sadly, many women fall into this position.
 

 This is when I discovered Joi Wellness. And Joi does exactly that - they went deeper.
 

 A nurse will come to your home and draw your blood (so nice for busy moms), then a physician will analyze your PERSONAL biomarkers and results. I scheduled a call with Dr. Estes and he thoroughly explained ALL of my biomarkers, deficiencies, and results. It was INCREDIBLY helpful.
 

 We found that I had elevated cortisol levels and my free testosterone levels were rather low, amongst other things.
 

 He listened to my symptoms and based on that and my biomarkers, created a custom plan for optimization - that now gets delivered to my door. Peptimes, smart supplements, and more - in therapeutic doses.
 

 I 100% know that miscarriages arenÕt always a result of deficiencies, but as we consider whether to embark on another pregnancy, I feel confident that I have some answers and IÕm working in the right direction to take care of my health.
 

 Very grateful for Joi Wellness, and highly recommend this company to anyone who wants to take control of their health!

 LetÕs also make a list of something you would like for MotherÕs Day - list all your favorites!
 

 Here are the top 12 I found in forums online:
 

 1. A good nights sleep.
 2. A clean house and the laundry done.
 3. A clean car.
 4. To not be in charge of decisions.
 5. A night alone in a hotel. 
 6. A family activity that mom does NOT have to plan or manage.
 7. A day to be a person outside of a mom.
 8. A day of ÒmeÓ time.
 9. A spa or nail day.
 10. A homemade gift.
 11. Kids that are good people.
 12. Brunch that I didnÕt have to make or plan.
 

 Personally, I would love number 5 the night before MotherÕs Day. To sleep in, workout, and enjoy the morning with myself. Then, have the boys come to the hotel for a later lunch, then off to an activity I didnÕt plan. IÕd come home and the house would be perfectly clean and laundry put away. I wind down the day with my 11Õs (kids that are AMAZING people) and the give me 10Õs (homemade gifts). Either that, or just a normal day of being a mom. ______

 ... to get the link to the book, ÒThe MediatricianÕs Guide: A Joyful Approach to Raising Healthy, Smart, Kind Kids in a Screen-Saturated World.Ó Author and founder of the Boston ChildrenÕs Hospital @digitalwellnesslab, Dr. Michael Rich, has some great tips, including:
 

 -Specific evidence-based tips by developmental age.
 -How to work with childcare providers and schools regarding screen usage.
 -Fun alternatives to screens and how to bring back boredom.
 -The Killer BEÕs: be mindful, be balanced, be bored, be present.
 -The 3 MÕs for parents: model screen use, mentor your childrenÕs screen use, monitor their screen use.
 

 When Ryan and I first became parents, we agreed that screens would play a minimal part in our family. But then, you have kids and there are times when screens have been SUPER helpful, especially when my kids were little. We were still very much a limited screen family, only using them strategically. #HarperHoizonPartner
 

 As my boys grew to the age of about five, watching ÒshowsÓ slowed down. At that point, we didnÕt need screens to help Ògive us a minuteÓ I know this is probably the reverse of the standards for kids, but it has worked for us!
 

 Now, our littlest, Quade, who is two and a half probably gets the most amount of screentime for that reason and the older boys are rarely with screens with the exception of a nighttime hockey game or occasional family movie.
 

 ItÕs worked for us not to do iPads with the exception of travel and video games were something we agreed to keep out of the house. 
 

 Somehow our boys are okay with minimal TV and I feel like they rarely ask for a show - minus Beauden (4) - he asks for shows. But everyone is more focused on other things - each other, fighting lol, playing outside, playing sports, playing with the neighbors, puttering around the house! 
 

 Sure, everyone likes a little downtime TV once in a while, but weÕve figured out how to not make it the focus and our kids have been totally fine with it. @harperhorizon"	brookeraybould	Brooke Raybould	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/347818603_571591758186661_1293263663191613457_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=KZlq1MVzWn4Q7kNvgHSvm26&gid=d5857627336c4b6686d37701c86fdd58&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYC_YugkOd-7FUTvQo7ViThHmhXR0pRODb0Cf7PBIOSkKg&oe=66B1007F&_nc_sid=0b30b7	2024-04-09 16:47:07	video	https://www.instagram.com/p/C5i2hIeg6c2	https://instagram.fgrq1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/435764390_804187704950421_8347903897802278867_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi43MjB4MTI4MC5zZHIuZjI5MzUwIn0&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=TuoifnogmXkQ7kNvgGAcXi6&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzM0MjQ3MzY0NDgxODU0MDM0Mg%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYA0z1SXWlDRp_0KkMbFG3rSjG_8NmsuYkUbOeAxmTjeww&oe=66B104FA&_nc_sid=0b30b7	https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/o1/v/t16/f1/m82/CE42203BBCD009260791AEB77CCEE5B6_video_dashinit.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6Inhwdl9wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS5JTlNUQUdSQU0uQ0xJUFMuQzMuNzIwLmRhc2hfYmFzZWxpbmVfMV92MSJ9&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&vs=7bb3020faa8c4254&_nc_vs=HBksFQIYT2lnX3hwdl9yZWVsc19wZXJtYW5lbnRfcHJvZC9DRTQyMjAzQkJDRDAwOTI2MDc5MUFFQjc3Q0NFRTVCNl92aWRlb19kYXNoaW5pdC5tcDQVAALIAQAVAhg6cGFzc3Rocm91Z2hfZXZlcnN0b3JlL0dBQ3dCQnBfdExMMDlxUUNBUGY2NFhxbFhLRVFicV9FQUFBRhUCAsgBACgAGAAbAogHdXNlX29pbAExEnByb2dyZXNzaXZlX3JlY2lwZQExFQAAJpCc9u7B8osDFQIoAkMzLBdATEAAAAAAABgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB1%2FgcA&ccb=9-4&oh=00_AYAttZTMlfuHlkA4tJo3lMblJvR4Aya7o5GiPIUVPaQnTA&oe=66AD350C&_nc_sid=1d576d	HarperHoizonPartner	6981	2243	1				1712674027	435764390_804187704950421_8347903897802278867_n.jpg	Harper Horizon	@harperhorizon	Strategy book on how to achieve limited screen time for children	Children

 MILK TASTE TEST OPTIONS:
 1. Regular Milk
 2. Oat Milk
 3. Almond Milk
 4. Darigold FIT Milk (high protein, low sugar)
 

 The boys walked into the kitchen setup for the blind taste test, SO excited. I told them NOT TO LOOK at the labels. They tasted all four milks diligently, took it seriously, provided value-add commentary, and enjoyed every moment!
 

 Final Verdict: Darigold FIT is the winner! 
 

 With 40 grams of protein and 40% less sugar than other milks, Darigold FIT is not only a winner in the boysÕ taste test book, but also in my book as a mom. ItÕs family farmer made with no artificial sweeteners or growth hormones. Raybould-approved!

 É And comment the word ÒKINDERÓ to get these LIMITED EDITION Kinder Joy Easter eggs. ______
 

 This Easter season, Kinder Joy is offering twelve new limited edition mini game Easter toys. The boys love the Pinata, Ring Toss, and thereÕs plenty more! 
 

 Truth be told, egg hunts can get crazy at our house. Not only are our boys competitive, but we have many different ages to appease. Surprisingly, this is the winning strategy that has worked. The little boys feel special being able to hunt ÒspecialÓ eggs, along with standard eggs. This gives them a leg up. And the big boys, being more mature, simply like the thrill of the numbers. They have the wherewithal to hold their composure and trade in some eggs for a special Kinder Joy Easter egg at the end. Sometimes we repeat the hunt multiple times to get the most bang for our buck. The boys love it. 
 

 AndÉ the Kinder Joy Easter eggs are nice because they come with a treat AND a toy - that provides hours of fun. They come in two halves.. The first half is a treat with two soft cream layers Ð one sweet -cream flavored and one cocoa flavored. And two wafer bites. The second half is the limited edition mini game Easter toy. 
 

 Have any additional recommendations or fun egg hunt ideas? Leave them in the comments! Us parents want to know the secrets of orderly and enjoyable egg hunts! ____"	brookeraybould	Brooke Raybould	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/347818603_571591758186661_1293263663191613457_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=KZlq1MVzWn4Q7kNvgHSvm26&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDCp0-4VyK0lKY2nMOOpQtXaZ9MKWcZmAC-VCmUaz8dJQ&oe=66B1007F&_nc_sid=0b30b7	2024-03-25 19:38:14	video	https://www.instagram.com/p/C48ojoHPDOj	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/434339935_779703567430995_6063447601967689614_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi43MjB4MTI4MC5zZHIuZjI5MzUwIn0&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=T3IPLZgtfg0Q7kNvgHILRFI&gid=308f2ccdc4cb4b72b9de28b52cb0c706&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzMzMTcxNjE5NDQ2MDUxMzE4Nw%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYDffB_LBHdaA4o3Oc0tYbWUK2xw_A5lHaGTctNbrKkPKg&oe=66B0FD88&_nc_sid=0b30b7	https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/o1/v/t16/f1/m82/AA42BA2455A25A1E41CBC367ECF5CFB7_video_dashinit.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6Inhwdl9wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS5JTlNUQUdSQU0uQ0xJUFMuQzMuNzIwLmRhc2hfYmFzZWxpbmVfMV92MSJ9&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&vs=9e3344d1fbd7611e&_nc_vs=HBksFQIYT2lnX3hwdl9yZWVsc19wZXJtYW5lbnRfcHJvZC9BQTQyQkEyNDU1QTI1QTFFNDFDQkMzNjdFQ0Y1Q0ZCN192aWRlb19kYXNoaW5pdC5tcDQVAALIAQAVAhg6cGFzc3Rocm91Z2hfZXZlcnN0b3JlL0dNdkw1Um0tTTdlWVdETUdBQXY3bTJoVkRLUmpicV9FQUFBRhUCAsgBACgAGAAbAogHdXNlX29pbAExEnByb2dyZXNzaXZlX3JlY2lwZQExFQAAJozvvIP73uwCFQIoAkMzLBdAP12yLQ5WBBgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB1%2FgcA&ccb=9-4&oh=00_AYDX8yuJpCH4dPEsjN4zEgWsGxctOIzl4HnPM8HtiPfN1A&oe=66AD3417&_nc_sid=1d576d	ad	957	83	1				1711391894	434339935_779703567430995_6063447601967689614_n.jpg	Kinder U.S.	@kinderus	Chocolate snack	Food

 Truth? Admittedly, I had a stash of plastic food storage containers in my kitchen even though I KNOW they are bad. Ugh. Why! We know that plastic contains BPA, which has been proven to be harmful to infants and children and is suspected to be just as problematic for adults. Even if plastic claims to be ÒBPA-Free,Ó there is a chance it has something called BPS, which apparently causes similar hormone disruption.
 

 The Caraway Home containers are SO PRETTY.... AND I can feel good knowing that my family is well taken care of. Rather than plastic, they are made with non-stick ceramic that is smooth as butter. If this sage color didnÕt catch your eye they have tons of other colors on their website.
 

 Sigh. I love pretty things for the kitchen that you can feel good about!

 É to get the link to these glasses (my favorite) called ÒPairÓ and use code ÒBROOKE15Ó for 15% off! Pair offers high-quality, affordable, and customizable prescription (+ blue light) glasses. They are known for their magnetic top frames that allow you to change your eyewear, and your style. Love them. 
 

 Not only are they fun, but they serve as a good reminder that how we experience life comes down to how we view it. This is especially true in motherhood.
 

 Happiness expert, Arthur Brooks, shares that our attitude is scientifically proven to impact the people around us. When a parent adopts a negative, or Òthis sucksÓ mindset, inherently your children can adopt this mindset.
 

 Ever seen your kids moping around being negative? Consider where they got it from.
 

 On the other hand, when a parent is positive and in pursuit of their own happiness, their children become more positive and happy themselves.
 

 I remind myself, I must be careful to label something as inherently ÒgoodÓ or Òbad.Ó And instead, I should take a step back to see how I can create more goodness and positivity out of a situation.

 É to get the link to my luggage, jean jacket, and white tee. Comment ÒBOOTSÓ for my boots and ÒPANTSÓ for my favorite shine leggings!
 

 A BIG shoutout to the BRAND NEW @aubergeresorts Bowie House @bowiehouseauberge in Fort Worth, TX. As soon as I arrived in this luxury hotel, I felt like I was home! ItÕs homage to Fort WorthÕs western heritage is perfectly executed and it made my stay an upscale country vacation. Highly recommend!
 

 You might be wondering, are we moving?!
 

 Not exactly. I booked a trip to Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas because there is a chance our family might move back in the near future.
 

 Why did I fly out if we donÕt know for sure? Well, when you have four kids you want to create a place that fully feels like Òhome,Ó you donÕt want it to be Òlast minuteÓ if the answer is ÒGO!Ó, and Texas is BIG.
 

 Ryan and I met when we both decided to leave our areas of ÒhomeÓ and start a new adventure and since then weÕve lived in four cities, had each of our boys in a unique city, and now itÕs likeÉ where is ÒhomeÓ going to be?
 

 Is it our current location? Virginia, which, the answer is yes. I believe home is who and what creates it. But, thereÕs also a piece that might work itself to create a new adventure, which looks like it could be TX.
 

 The key is not to wait until that moment to create ÒhomeÓ because it might not come. Focus on the now and make the moment count, and if a new ÒhomeÓ happens to transpire, we will make it perfect for us.
 

 I had this thought, thoughÉ Sometimes finding ÒhomeÓ reminds me of that book, ÒAre You My Mother?Ó I keep going from to place asking, ÒIs this our home?Ó But maybe the more important realization is that home isnÕt a destination; itÕs the journey. ItÕs less of a ÒwhereÓ and more of a ÒwhatÓ and Òwho.Ó __

 .... Sometimes as moms we make things a lot more complicated than they ought to be. We overcomplicate things and add too many ingredients for the sake of making it ÒspecialÓ when, in fact, one simple ingredient would do the trick. That was certainly the case for this recipe! 
 

 Not only is this ice cream simple, but it also has 14 grams of protein, 40% less sugar than other milks, and is lactose-free, thanks to Darigold FIT. A win-win in my book. All you need is farm fresh Darigold FIT Chocolate Milk - always free of artificial sweeteners and hormones - and an ice cream maker!

 Kinder Joy Eggs truly mimic the element of SURPRISE! Kinder Joy Eggs are egg-shaped treats that are taken apart into two halves. One half is filled with two soft cream layers - one sweet cream-flavored and one cocoa-flavored. The other half filled with a unique toy that allows for hours of fun. ItÕs no wonder these little treats have made a huge impact in the memory bank of my boys! #kinderjoy
 

 I never knew why I remembered the little (and big) surprises of life so vividly. From my parents surprising me at school to spend a special day together to (surprise!) finding out I was pregnant to little gifts along the way. The power of the surprise sequence and the emotion that even a little surprise can imprint in our hearts and minds, is SO big.
 

 Knowing this, it is all the more reason to integrate surprise into the lives of your kids!
 

 My boys LOVE Kinder Joy Eggs, so I knew that would be the treat to integrate into our surprise sequence. I always intend on writing my boys personal notes, but rarely get around to it. Now, was the perfect opportunity. With the handwritten notes, I taped them to hanging balloons from the ceiling. 
 

 The boys loved every moment, and I know they will treasure these little (but big!) moments forever, thanks to the element of surprise. ______"	brookeraybould	Brooke Raybould	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/347818603_571591758186661_1293263663191613457_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=KZlq1MVzWn4Q7kNvgHSvm26&gid=fc8c370d2dd44b40a09426928e636012&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDsBgN9DgD_P_G8d1f9bHWp598bzq8xPFHcsFTLHU9o-A&oe=66B1007F&_nc_sid=0b30b7	2024-02-14 19:24:10	video	https://www.instagram.com/p/C3VnjWVvsKH	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/427092219_942578780849723_3510168411709110617_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi43MjB4MTI4MC5zZHIuZjI5MzUwIn0&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=t7nd3cnOPZAQ7kNvgG2Jzhg&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzMwMjcxOTg1NDcyODg4ODk2Nw%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYAYcmQixw0EOQL7wuUnwOsuwTDRmzcWn9SLlqJg_gP8Wg&oe=66B13047&_nc_sid=0b30b7	https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/o1/v/t16/f1/m82/0540EC9ECC9A38B47E7F09D4783C0B99_video_dashinit.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6Inhwdl9wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS5JTlNUQUdSQU0uQ0xJUFMuQzMuNzIwLmRhc2hfYmFzZWxpbmVfMV92MSJ9&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&vs=e49cdb23b27f739a&_nc_vs=HBksFQIYT2lnX3hwdl9yZWVsc19wZXJtYW5lbnRfcHJvZC8wNTQwRUM5RUNDOUEzOEI0N0U3RjA5RDQ3ODNDMEI5OV92aWRlb19kYXNoaW5pdC5tcDQVAALIAQAVAhg6cGFzc3Rocm91Z2hfZXZlcnN0b3JlL0dKbFBhQmx2UHFDUEVqZ0hBSWhRcHo5R0Y0UnBicV9FQUFBRhUCAsgBACgAGAAbAogHdXNlX29pbAExEnByb2dyZXNzaXZlX3JlY2lwZQExFQAAJqr1w5T4wPgDFQIoAkMzLBdARful41P3zxgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB1%2FgcA&ccb=9-4&oh=00_AYCgbmJUvfv7CmsgZsRpVWCkDA-_ZSoqAJQk0YEhX5fw5w&oe=66AD2D80&_nc_sid=1d576d	ad,kinderjoy	2125	91	1				1707935050	427092219_942578780849723_3510168411709110617_n.jpg	Kinder U.S.	@kinderus	Chocolate snack	Food

 ... and use code ÒBROOKEÓ to get a limited time 10% discount on Caraway Home Cookware - OUR FAVORITE!
 

 There is nothing that I get compliments on more than our Caraway Home Cookware. Not only is this cookware beautifully designed, but it is made with a chemical-free ceramic coating. This coating must have some sort of magic in it because cooking requires FAR less oil and better and food does NOT stick to it. And, it makes for such easy cleaning. The leftover food melts off easily.
 

 We own the 4-piece Cookware Set - that allows me to cook anything and everything. I love Caraway so much that I placed an order for the bakeware, as well (in addition to the baking sheet I recently bought after Christmas with my discount!). 
 

 Caraway comes in a variety of pretty colors that will elevate your kitchen to an entirely new level.

 É to get a 30-day FREE trial of the workout + wellness app I use, Alo Moves, available TODAY and TOMORROW ONLY! ____
 

 If you know me, you know how passionate I am about wellness for moms. But, it wasnÕt always this way. I WANTED to be someone who incorporated fitness, mindfulness, and overall self-care, but I couldnÕt crack the consistency code and make the habits stick. Here are some pointers.
 

 1. Know WHY you are doing the particular habit. For example, I workout because the energy (endorphins) and mental focus (dopamine) I get from a workout is PRICELESS. You must associate the habit with something positive; not something negative (like weight loss).
 

 2. Start small with a routine that is DOABLE. The worst thing you can do is practice a habit that is too long or too difficult. Shorten it up; find something you like that doesnÕt kill you. This is where the @alomoves app comes in. Alo Moves offers over 3,000 classes and goal-based series for every level and background - from mindfulness to fitness to meditation and breath work. Once you master one habit, you can then increase the metric/difficulty and/or add another habit.
 

 3. Try practicing a habit first thing in the morning or have a designated TIME that you canÕt wiggle your way out of. I like the morning because there is pressure for me to do it before my kids are up. If I miss the window; I miss the habit and that is a no-go.
 

 4. Never miss TWICE. This is from James ClearÕs book ÒAtomic Habits.Ó On average, it takes 66 days to build a circuit in your brain the makes a habit anticipatory (and somewhat automatic). If you miss once, you wonÕt break the habit, but if you miss twice you risk breaking the habit. 
 

 Those are my tips! Be sure and take advantage of JanuaryÕs 30-day free trial offer to get started with the Alo Moves app! #AloMovesPartner"	brookeraybould	Brooke Raybould	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/347818603_571591758186661_1293263663191613457_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=KZlq1MVzWn4Q7kNvgHSvm26&gid=fc8c370d2dd44b40a09426928e636012&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDsBgN9DgD_P_G8d1f9bHWp598bzq8xPFHcsFTLHU9o-A&oe=66B1007F&_nc_sid=0b30b7	2024-01-30 20:51:26	video	https://www.instagram.com/p/C2vJdJKvEyY	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/423770403_635604798651425_5076680248408390487_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi43MjB4MTI4MC5zZHIuZjI5MzUwIn0&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=5Rf0rqqoHZ0Q7kNvgGu58Hs&gid=fc8c370d2dd44b40a09426928e636012&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzI5MTg5MTQzNzc1ODMzNjE1Mg%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYBQQbX_Eqbc1QkZz-bOLytxKVNzCW6s8B4mW0M3lmi3YQ&oe=66B12CF7&_nc_sid=0b30b7	https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/o1/v/t16/f1/m82/BC44B5EF7CE4C21A13E8074FC13F189C_video_dashinit.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6Inhwdl9wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS5JTlNUQUdSQU0uQ0xJUFMuQzMuNzIwLmRhc2hfYmFzZWxpbmVfMV92MSJ9&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&vs=34abcb6a7d18c340&_nc_vs=HBksFQIYT2lnX3hwdl9yZWVsc19wZXJtYW5lbnRfcHJvZC9CQzQ0QjVFRjdDRTRDMjFBMTNFODA3NEZDMTNGMTg5Q192aWRlb19kYXNoaW5pdC5tcDQVAALIAQAVAhg6cGFzc3Rocm91Z2hfZXZlcnN0b3JlL0dGU2dOUmtKR1RFNk5hNENBRldGZlR1NTVUdDFicV9FQUFBRhUCAsgBACgAGAAbAogHdXNlX29pbAExEnByb2dyZXNzaXZlX3JlY2lwZQExFQAAJuDJjKfZyrUBFQIoAkMzLBdASgzMzMzMzRgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB1%2FgcA&ccb=9-4&oh=00_AYDYha-E1bcpCLHM1WzBHwOBimKjD4atI6SIoaka2CAI2g&oe=66AD0729&_nc_sid=1d576d	AloMovesPartner	3417	415	1				1706644286	423770403_635604798651425_5076680248408390487_n.jpg	Alo Moves	@alomoves	Fitness and meditation classes on a digital platform	Health & Wellness

 1. Orange Chicken + Cauliflower Rice
 2. Gnocchi alla Sorrentina with Sausage + Marinara
 3. Carne Asada Tacos
 4. Salmon with Broccoli Slaw + Sweet Chili Sauce
 5. Chicken Parmesan over Ravilio
 

 To be honest, I forget about Trader JoeÕs sometimes. Not sure why because I feel like it was MADE for moms (and twenty-something year olds).
 

 While I LOVE cooking for my family, sometimes going ingredient by ingredient drains me, even when I have many of the same meals in rotation. I was telling Ryan the other day that the future of grocery shopping will be made for moms.
 

 It will be a big box warehouse and all orders will be made online through an app. Within the app, you will be able to get family-friendly recipes with ALL the ingredients that you can add to your cart with the tap of a button based on the number of people youÕre serving. Of course, you can add favorites saved from your last trip. Your grocery list then delivers directly to your door. Would you sign up for this?! I WOULD.
 

 I guess this is Instacart, but more efficient? A girl can dream.
 

 Anyways! These recipes are AMAZING for a fifteen minute prep and serve family dinner and they are a HIT with all the boys. Be sure and watch my stories - I share meal ideas regularly!
 

 Again, comment RECIPE and IÕll send the list over for FREE!

 Oftentimes, I get asked what I do for me as a mom to four boys. In the beginning of motherhood, I thought that getting hours alone to myself was considered Òself-care.Ó While it worked, the truth is, I needed something more.
 

 What became of my ÒmoreÓ were daily practices of discipline. Understandably, people donÕt want to hear that self-care is work. But, for me, it was the best kind of work that truly nourished my body, mind, and soul. It meant working on myself so that I could show up better for me, and also for my family.
 

 To help get you started, Beyond Body offers a CUSTOM 28-day program, including a workout plan and a meal plan. Workouts are based on your progress level and meal plans include thousands of cheap and delicious meal variations that donÕt require chef skills or fancy ingredients. 
 

 Beyond Body meets you where youÕre at and expands your knowledge of what (I believe) true self-care is.

 To add onto this wrapping paper idea, I thought it would be cute for Christmas morning. On top of the wrapping paper, you could write ÒNaughty or Nice.Ó Then, the note beyond the wrapping paper would have the answer: You made this NICE list! 
 

 As always, we love to incorporate ElmerÕs Squishies into the Christmas gift mix. Our boys LOVE the DIY aspect. It integrates nicely into our homeschool day and feels like a gift, but also a productive hands-on activity. 
 

 Simply mix the ingredients, pour it into the Mystery Mold, and after 60 minutes, pop out your mystery characters and play!

 Real talk: the holidays can be a lot as a mom. But after reading more about it, there are a few key things to focus on that might make you happier during the holidays. Here they are:

 3. Decorating early / decorating in general!
 4. Spending quality time with family.

 ____ É and comment the word ÒBOOKÓ to get 50% off your first Chatbooks Monthbook. Starting at $10 a month get your photos off of your phone and into a monthly book, delivered straight to your door!
 

 IÕve been creating content for six years and these are the shortcuts to DIY Family Photos with your phone:
 

 1. Use Portrait Mode. This gives a blurred background, or bokeh effect, focusing on the subject matter.
 2. Use Natural Light. Photos taken outside or close to a window *usually* turn out better because you can use the sun to your advantage. Make sure your phone is between the sun and your subject matter. And take photos during the golden hours (1 hour after sunrise and 1 hour before sunset).
 3. Use a Tripod and a Clicker. Comment the word ÒTRIPODÓ and IÕll send you the link for mine.
 4. Use Presets, if you can. Presets are high-quality filters applied to photos that make the images pop.
 

 Comment the word ÒGUIDEÓ and IÕll send you a more in-depth guide to DIY Family Photos, including my presets! Most importantly, get the photos OFF your phone and into a book with Chatbooks! #ChatbooksPartner"	brookeraybould	Brooke Raybould	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-19/347818603_571591758186661_1293263663191613457_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=1&_nc_ohc=KZlq1MVzWn4Q7kNvgHSvm26&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AYDCp0-4VyK0lKY2nMOOpQtXaZ9MKWcZmAC-VCmUaz8dJQ&oe=66B1007F&_nc_sid=0b30b7	2023-12-14 21:43:25	video	https://www.instagram.com/p/C02Ob00PICR	https://instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.29350-15/409954293_1851945518576796_6552829033118623362_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImltYWdlX3VybGdlbi4xMjA2eDIxNDAuc2RyLmYyOTM1MCJ9&_nc_ht=instagram.fgrq1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=kWO5nycHvi4Q7kNvgH24vle&edm=AFg4Q8wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzI1Nzg1NDg2NTIzNzExNTAyNQ%3D%3D.2-ccb7-5&oh=00_AYBhYqZTVRox9wZNkm91XGvCryN-toNTKAmyW18b-azzMQ&oe=66B1252D&_nc_sid=0b30b7	https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/o1/v/t16/f1/m82/C149E76815A758EE4146E7DAC17646A1_video_dashinit.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6Inhwdl9wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS5JTlNUQUdSQU0uQ0xJUFMuQzMuNzIwLmRhc2hfYmFzZWxpbmVfMV92MSJ9&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&vs=6992aa420a9658a1&_nc_vs=HBksFQIYT2lnX3hwdl9yZWVsc19wZXJtYW5lbnRfcHJvZC9DMTQ5RTc2ODE1QTc1OEVFNDE0NkU3REFDMTc2NDZBMV92aWRlb19kYXNoaW5pdC5tcDQVAALIAQAVAhg6cGFzc3Rocm91Z2hfZXZlcnN0b3JlL0dHNFhmaGdObUZfck9CY0ZBRXhhVmtoWWlUa2FicV9FQUFBRhUCAsgBACgAGAAbAogHdXNlX29pbAExEnByb2dyZXNzaXZlX3JlY2lwZQExFQAAJu6f1LrD6foEFQIoAkMzLBdAQ0AAAAAAABgSZGFzaF9iYXNlbGluZV8xX3YxEQB1%2FgcA&ccb=9-4&oh=00_AYBL0pZGqenIBGtZo22xNcU6ewKlohwjn11ym1y3x5imwA&oe=66AD3A92&_nc_sid=1d576d	ChatbooksPartner	1188	261	1				1702586605	409954293_1851945518576796_6552829033118623362_n.jpg	Chatbooks	"@chatbooks

 1. Comment the word ÒRINGÓ

 Do yÕall LOVE the boysÕ choice?! I may have dropped a few hints or twoÉ and coincidentally, the majority of you voted on my stories for oval, as well!! 
 

 Hitting our ten-year anniversary feels like a huge milestone! Even more, raising FOUR boys these last ten years. It only felt natural to include the boys in the ring upgrade process. And when I say ÒupgradeÓ, we actually kept my original ring in tact. It was too sentimental to change it up and IÕd love to pass it down, as it is a natural diamond. Instead, of trading in my old ring, we opted for a lab-grown diamond ring.
 

 Lab-grown diamonds are identical to natural diamonds, but they are sourced in a lab. According to Rare Carat, ÒLab-grown diamonds are not imitations or simulants. They have the same physical, chemical, and optical properties as mined diamonds - the only difference being their origin.Ó
 

 They are ethically sourced and are a fraction of the cost of a natural diamond. This allowed us to keep my original and go a little wild with the new ring. A.k.a. My ÒfunÓ ring!
 

 Thanks for sharing this journey with us! ____

 Can I tell you the cool thing about having kids? And four kids, at thatÉ
 

 Your expectation for perfect holiday traditions goes out the window. When I first became a mom, I stressed so badly about having things be perfect - especially around the holidays. I wanted the perfect cards, the perfect holiday jammies, the perfect traditions, the perfect Christmas morning wakeup.
 

 Now, I still want the joy of those memories, but IÕve learned that the joy lies in the imperfection and my embracing of it. Only took me nine plus years to get here.

 The nice thing about them is that they are an interactive and educational toy. We gifted them early to test them out for you all, and they are a hit! Rhett sat and studiously read the directions to Vance. They worked together to mix the ingredients, pour their molds, and patiently waited the 60 minutes (delayed gratification) for their hard work to come to fruition!

 The holidays came early at our house, and the boys LOVE their new Garmin Bounce Smartwatches! Bounce is the perfect gift for parents who prefer to delay access to a smartphone, but want the positive benefits of one! __
 

 Frequently Asked Questions about the Garmin Bounce Smartwatch:
 

 __Do you need an extra cell phone plan to use the watches? No. The watches operate on the parentÕs phone through the Garmin Jr. App.
 __Are the watches easy to use for kids? Yes. My boys became familiar with all the features within a day of using the smartwatch.
 __Does the parent need a Garmin Watch to communicate with the kids? No. The watches are made to communicate with each other through the Garmin Jr. App. (with messages, step counting, etc.), but you can do this via the app, as well. I have the Garmin Venu 3 watch, which I love and helps, but is not required. 
 __Are the watches waterproof? Yes!
 __Can kids access the internet? Nope.
 __Can you set location boundaries? Yes. You can set a boundary within the Garmin Jr. App and if your child leaves the boundary you will get a notification.
 __How does location tracking work? The parent or guardian can live track the child instantly, view their location, and location history through the Garmin Jr. App.
 

 The watches currently come in Black Camo, Lilac Floral, and Green Burst #GarminAmbassador

 The sets come in a variety of gorgeous colors (black + gold, white + gold, and more!). I chose the silt green, and IÕm simply obsessed. __
 

 ¥ Caraway is made without any toxic materials like PFAS, PTFE, PFOA, or other hard-to-pronounce chemicals.
 ¥ Made with ceramic - naturally non-stick.
 ¥ Top-notch design!
 
 

 But, seriously. I COULD NOT believe this about aluminum foil. IÕve been cooking with aluminum foil for years. Ugh. RyanÕs brother had mentioned the problem with chips and scratches in cookware, but itÕs taken me up until this point to THROW IT OUT.
 

 Cookware feels like a big investment, but when you consider the health of your family and hopefully eh longevity you get investing in a high-quality set, it will more than pay for itself in the future. ____ #Carawaypartner

 Letting our state know we were homeschooling was NERVE-RACKING. But, this ended up being the EASIEST process. If youÕre scared, donÕt be. And, I hope this video helps!
 

 ____First: I have a 20% discount to IXL Learning. Comment the word ÒIXLÓ and I will send you the link (or go to the link in my bio)! The subscription starts at $7.96/month and is worth it.
 

 IXL will provide your state standards, including the Common Core State Standards, the Next Generation Science Standards, and all U.S. state standards - which is incredibly helpful. ____ We also like to use IXL for our regular diagnostic assessments. These are great for homeschool kids AND regular school kids! Not only do we use IXL to test and pinpoint grade-level proficiency, but we also use the program to build targeted skills. IXL has an entire database of skills required between K-12 grade levels that help us stay on track, and go deeper as needed!
 

 __ A few things to note about providing intent to homeschool! Always, always, always check with your state laws. This is certainly not legal advice, just the process I went through to provide our intent to homeschool.
 

 We received a ÒLetter of AcknowledgementÓ for each of our boys in less than 24 hours. Then, before August 1st, we will submit our Evidence of Progress.

 ____Comment the word ÒLOMIÓ to get the link!
 

 The boys and I became very interested in people who follow a zero waste lifestyle. The 5 RÕs of zero waste living are: Refusing, Reducing, Reusing, Recycling and Rot. __
 

 While itÕs an incredible mission, as a mom to four boys, I knew that zero-waste living probably wasnÕt in the cards, but we could certainly do SOMETHING to make a difference.
 

 With a little homeschool research, we found that 43% of food waste in the U.S. happens at the household level. And, the average American family loses $2,000 in food waste every year. This is serious news for a family with four boys. 
 

 This is when we discovered the Lomi Bloom. Lomi is the worldÕs first Smart Waste appliance that transforms almost anything we eat into nutrient-rich plant food in 3 hours! __
 

 With our Lomi Bloom, we reduce our waste footprints, feel a lot less guilty for what we throw out, and also turn our trash into cash with the Lomi Rewards program (we participate through the Lomi app). Oh, and we are starting to grow our own food with our Lomi Earth using the food we throw out (crazy)!
 

 This appliance is one of a kind, and itÕs been rewarding to see the boys understand the impact we can make.
 

 As a family, we highly recommend the Lomi Bloom.
